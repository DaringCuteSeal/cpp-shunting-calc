# Shunting-Yard Calculator

This project is a basic implementation of the [Shunting-Yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) which is used to parse an infix notation input and turn it into a list of tokens arranged with the [Postfix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation). The postfix tokens would then be evaluated using a stack-based algorithm.

P.S this is for my school assignment.
